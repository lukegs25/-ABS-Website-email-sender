## Key Features

### For Regular Admins:
✅ Upload CSV to their assigned audiences
✅ Download subscribers from their assigned audiences
✅ View upload success/error feedback
✅ Download sample CSV template
✅ Duplicate detection and prevention

### For Super Admins:
✅ All regular admin features
✅ Upload to any audience
✅ Download from any audience
✅ **Special feature**: Download ALL subscribers from ALL audiences in one CSV

## CSV Format

### Upload Format (Flexible):
```csv
email,major,is_student
user@example.com,Computer Science,true
teacher@example.com,Business,false
```

**Required:**
- `email` column (case-insensitive header matching)

**Optional:**
- `major` column
- `is_student` or `role` column

### Download Format:
```csv
email,audience,major,is_student,created_at
user@example.com,"AI in Business (main)","Computer Science","Student","1/15/2025"
```

## Security Considerations

✅ Admin authentication required for all operations
✅ Super admin check for "All Audiences" download
✅ Email validation (client and server)
✅ Duplicate prevention per audience
✅ SQL injection prevention (using Supabase parameterized queries)
✅ File type validation (CSV only)

## Testing Checklist

### Upload Testing:
- [ ] Upload CSV to specific audience as regular admin
- [ ] Upload CSV to specific audience as super admin
- [ ] Try uploading without selecting audience (should show alert)
- [ ] Upload CSV with only email column
- [ ] Upload CSV with all columns (email, major, is_student)
- [ ] Upload duplicate emails (should skip duplicates)
- [ ] Upload invalid file type (should show error)
- [ ] Upload empty CSV (should show error)
- [ ] Upload CSV with missing email column (should show error)
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Test click-to-browse functionality
- [ ] Download and verify template CSV

### Download Testing:
- [ ] Download from specific audience as regular admin
- [ ] Download from specific audience as super admin
- [ ] Download "All Audiences" as super admin (option should be visible)
- [ ] Verify "All Audiences" option is NOT visible for regular admin
- [ ] Download with no subscribers (should show alert)
- [ ] Verify CSV filename includes audience name and date
- [ ] Verify CSV content is correctly formatted
- [ ] Verify all columns are present in download

### UI/UX Testing:
- [ ] Verify upload section has blue gradient background
- [ ] Verify download section has green gradient background
- [ ] Verify file upload component shows file details after selection
- [ ] Verify upload progress message appears during upload
- [ ] Verify success message shows correct stats (inserted, skipped)
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Verify upload area is disabled when no audience selected
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Test with long audience names
- [ ] Test with many audiences in dropdown

### Integration Testing:
- [ ] Upload subscribers and verify they appear in subscriber list
- [ ] Upload to audience A, verify they don't appear in audience B
- [ ] Upload duplicates, verify they're skipped and original remains
- [ ] Download immediately after upload, verify new subscribers included
- [ ] Refresh page after upload, verify subscribers persist

## Known Limitations

1. **CSV Parsing**: Basic comma-separated parsing - doesn't handle:
   - Commas within quoted fields
   - Multi-line fields
   - Various CSV dialects
   
   **Workaround**: Use simple CSV files without complex content

2. **File Size**: No explicit file size limit implemented
   
   **Recommendation**: Add file size validation for very large CSVs

3. **Progress Bar**: No progress indicator for large file uploads
   
   **Future Enhancement**: Add progress bar for files with many rows

4. **Error Details**: Doesn't show which specific rows failed
   
   **Future Enhancement**: Provide detailed error report per row

## API Endpoints Summary

### GET /api/admin/subscribers
**Purpose**: Fetch all subscribers with statistics
**Auth**: Admin required
**Response**: 
```json
{
  "subscribers": [...],
  "stats": {
    "total": 100,
    "students": 80,
    "teachers": 20,
    "uniqueEmails": 95,
    "byAudience": { "8": 50, "7": 30, ... }
  }
}
```

### POST /api/admin/subscribers
**Purpose**: Upload subscribers from CSV
**Auth**: Admin required
**Request**:
```json
{
  "audienceId": "8",
  "subscribers": [
    { "email": "user@example.com", "major": "CS", "is_student": true }
  ]
}
```
**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "inserted": 5,
  "skipped": 2,
  "total": 7,
  "message": "Successfully added 5 new subscriber(s). Skipped 2 duplicate(s)."
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

**Tested/Expected to work:**
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)

**Dependencies on modern browser features:**
- FileReader API (for reading CSV files)
- Blob API (for downloading CSVs)
- Fetch API (for AJAX requests)
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, async/await, etc.)

## Performance Considerations

1. **Large CSV Files**: 
   - Files with 1000+ rows may take a few seconds to process
   - No chunking implemented - entire file processed at once

2. **Network**:
   - Bulk insert used for efficiency (single database call)
   - Duplicate check done with single query (in clause)

3. **Memory**:
   - Entire CSV loaded into memory before processing
   - Fine for files up to ~10MB

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1 (High Impact):
- [ ] Add progress bar for large uploads
- [ ] Row-by-row error reporting
- [ ] Batch processing for very large files (chunking)
- [ ] Import history/audit log

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have):
- [ ] Excel file support (.xlsx)
- [ ] JSON import/export
- [ ] Column mapping interface (for non-standard CSVs)
- [ ] Email validation preview before import
- [ ] Rollback functionality
- [ ] Scheduled imports
- [ ] Import from URL

### Priority 3 (Low Priority):
- [ ] Multi-audience upload in single CSV
- [ ] Bulk edit functionality
- [ ] Merge duplicate strategy options
- [ ] Custom field mapping

## Deployment Notes

### Before Deploying:
1. ✅ Dependencies installed (`pnpm install`)
2. ✅ No linter errors
3. ✅ Test in development environment
4. ⚠️ Test with production Supabase instance
5. ⚠️ Verify admin authentication works in production
6. ⚠️ Test file upload size limits in production

### Environment Variables Needed:
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (or appropriate auth key)
- Admin authentication credentials in database

### Database Requirements:
- `new_subscribers` table with columns:
  - `email` (text)
  - `audience_id` (integer)
  - `is_student` (boolean)
  - `major` (text, nullable)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

## Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:
- Number of CSV uploads per day
- Average number of subscribers per upload
- Duplicate rate (skipped vs inserted)
- Error rate (failed uploads)
- Download frequency (by audience vs all)
- User feedback on the feature

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common User Issues:

**"CSV won't upload"**
→ Check file has .csv extension
→ Verify email column exists
→ Ensure audience is selected

**"All my subscribers were skipped"**
→ They're likely already in that audience
→ Check subscriber list to verify

**"Can't download all audiences"**
→ This is a super admin only feature
→ Regular admins can only download their assigned audiences
