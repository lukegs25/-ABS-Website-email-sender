# Email Attachment Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added functionality to attach files and images to email campaigns in the Email Composer.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: `components/ui/attachment-upload.jsx`
- Drag-and-drop file upload component
- Supports multiple files
- File validation (10MB per file, 40MB total)
- Displays file previews with names, sizes, and icons
- Individual file removal capability
- Supported file types:
  - Images: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg
  - Documents: pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, txt

### 2. Updated: `components/EmailComposer.jsx`
- Added `attachments` state to manage uploaded files
- Implemented `convertFilesToBase64()` function to encode files for email transmission
- Integrated AttachmentUpload component into the form
- Attachments are automatically cleared on successful email send
- Files are converted to base64 before being sent to the API

### 3. Updated: `app/api/admin/send-email/route.js`
- Accepts `attachments` array in request body
- Passes attachments to Resend API for both:
  - Test mode (direct email send)
  - Production mode (broadcast send)
- Attachment format: `{ filename, content (base64), type }`

## How It Works

1. **User uploads files** via drag-and-drop or file picker
2. **Files are validated** for size and type
3. **On form submission**, files are converted to base64
4. **API receives** attachment data and includes it in Resend payload
5. **Resend API** handles attachment delivery with emails

## Usage

In the Email Composer:
1. Fill in subject and content as usual
2. Click "Choose Files" or drag files into the attachment area
3. Multiple files can be added
4. Remove unwanted files by clicking the X button
5. Send email as normal - attachments will be included

## Technical Details

- **File encoding**: Base64
- **Size limits**: 10MB per file, 40MB total
- **Transmission**: Files sent as JSON in request body
- **API compatibility**: Uses Resend's attachment format
- **No additional dependencies**: Uses native HTML5 File API

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Navigate to the email composer
2. Upload a test file (image or PDF recommended)
3. Send to a test audience
4. Verify attachment is received in email
