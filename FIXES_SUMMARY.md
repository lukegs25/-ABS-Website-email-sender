# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Supabase Client Configuration Error
**Problem**: Users receiving error: "@supabase/ssr: Your project's URL and API key are required to create a Supabase client!"

**Solution**: Added missing environment variable to `.env.local`
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY=your-anon-key-here`
- **IMPORTANT**: You need to replace `your-anon-key-here` with actual anon key from Supabase dashboard
- **CRITICAL**: Must also add this to Vercel environment variables and redeploy

**Details**: See `SUPABASE_SETUP_FIX.md`

### 2. ✅ New Audiences Not Appearing in Signup Forms
**Problem**: When admin creates new audiences, they don't show up in student/teacher signup forms

**Solution**: Made forms dynamically fetch audiences from database

**Changes Made**:
1. Created new API endpoint: `/api/audiences/route.js`
   - Public endpoint (no auth required)
   - Returns all audiences with IDs and names
   
2. Updated `StudentForm.jsx`:
   - Fetches audiences on page load
   - Dynamically maps audiences to checkboxes
   - Resolves audience IDs by name patterns
   
3. Updated `TeacherForm.jsx`:
   - Fetches audiences on page load
   - Dynamically maps audiences to checkboxes
   - Resolves audience IDs by name patterns

**Details**: See `DYNAMIC_AUDIENCES_UPDATE.md`

## Next Steps

### For Local Development:
1. Get your Supabase anon key from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xbwxneswahlzaqosnqft/settings/api
2. Update `.env.local` with the actual anon key
3. Restart dev server: `pnpm dev`
4. Test signup forms

### For Production (Vercel):
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
   - **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY`
   - **Value**: [your anon key from Supabase]
   - **Environments**: All (Production, Preview, Development)
3. **REDEPLOY** the site

### Testing the Fixes:

#### Test 1: Signup Forms Work
1. Go to `/student` page
2. Fill out form and submit
3. Should successfully subscribe (no Supabase error)

#### Test 2: New Audiences Appear
1. As admin, create a new audience (e.g., "Data Science")
2. Go to `/student` or `/teacher` signup page
3. New audience should appear in checkboxes (if name matches patterns)
4. Submit form with new audience selected
5. Verify subscription is created in database

## Technical Details

### Audience Name Pattern Matching:
For audiences to automatically appear in forms, they should include these keywords:

**Student Form**:
- "scai" + "student" → SCAI Students
- "finance" → Finance
- "marketing" → Marketing
- "semi" or "conductor" → Semi-Conductors
- "accounting" → Accounting

**Teacher Form**:
- "scai" + "teacher" → SCAI Teachers
- "teacher" + "support" → Teachers supporting students
- "finance", "marketing", "semi/conductor", "accounting" → Same as above

**Both Forms**:
- "ai in business" or "main" → Main newsletter
- "etc", "general", or "other" → Other areas interest

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Supabase errors**: Check that anon key is set in both `.env.local` AND Vercel
